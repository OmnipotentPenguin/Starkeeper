## The Brief

The brief was to create an OOP-based application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. The application must manipulate two tables with full CRUD functionality.

### The Solution

The solution was an Article Storage tool, dubbed StarKeeper, that allows a user to store sets of data pertaining to a web link in a table, with each data set tied to a series of tags that would summarize the contained information.

This required two tables (an article table and a tag table) tied together by a many-to-many relationship, where each article can have multiple tags, and each tag can be assigned to multiple articles.

## The Development
<a name="init"></a>
### Initial Plan
#### Entity Relationship Diagram - Initial
![Initial ERD](/Documentation/Starkeeper_ERD.png)

The initial ERD consisted of 3 tables: 
* Articles
* Tags 
* Users

An additional joining table was tied between the article and tag tables, which was then itself tied to the users table. It was later decided that this level of complexity was unnecessary for a first iteration, and so the users table along with its joining table were dropped from the project.

#### Wireframes

Wireframes, built off of the ERD's and taking into account acceptance criteria, were developed to better visualise the interactions a user may have with the product.

#### API Development

A simple API Development Diagram developed to visualise the back-end functions of the application.

### Delivered solution

In addition to the removal of the user table, the final ERD had many of the article values stripped away. This was done to simplify interactions with the user and minimize superfluous entries to each article. Instead, greater focus could be placed on the tag inputs to provide additional information.

## Testing

JUnit, Mockito and Selenium were used for automated testing, with test coverage for the backend at 90.1%. SonarQube was used for static reporting and refactoring.

## Deployment

This project implements a basic CI/CD pipeline using github, jenkins, docker hub, nexus and aws.
The project uses jenkins ([download guide](https://jenkins.io/download/)) to pull any new commits from github and then build them using a [Jenkinsfile](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/). The built jar is then sent on to [nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/download-oss-sonatype) where it is safely stored for later use. The jar is then placed into a [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) container by a Dockerfile and uploaded to [docker hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/). An AWS [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html) that is running on a [VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/index.html) with a mysql [RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rds/index.html) on it the pulls down the updated docker image from docker hub and starts running the new container at the prompting of the Jenkinsfile through ssh connection.

## Improvements for the Future

Current functionality for StarKeeper becomes quite limited when the number of articles increase beyond the size of the webpage. In future iterations, I'd like to begin the development for the search and filtering functionality that was considered at the start of the project, potentially searching through name and description or including an additional tag drop-down list that filters results based on the selected tags.

Beyond that, I would like to revisit the idea of multiple user accounts, each with a personal list of tags and articles, which interaction between user accounts over the homepage (such as trending articles) or a shared rating system for each article.
